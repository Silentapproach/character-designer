This "character designer" is mainly thought as a tool for situations where someone needs to design characters and have them represented in their byte / hex format. 

The heart of the designer is its "canvas" represented as a grid of 12 x 3 "bytes" that are each 8 bits long (8 pixels - represented as a vertical "line"). 
The bytes are read from left to right and from top to bottom. So the first byte is the one in the top left corner and the last one is the one in the bottom right corner.

The byte's least significant bit is the on the top and the most significant bit is on the bottom.
